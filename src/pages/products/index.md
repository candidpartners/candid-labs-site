        your data centers is crucial to ensuring your applications will run
        effectively in the cloud. Volker offers the ability to map your existing
        server assets into geographic locations so that you can analyze latency
        dependencies between your existing data centers and your new cloud based

        There are so many options for migrating an application to the cloud that
        it can stall many cloud migration projects getting everyone involved to
        understand the pros and cons for different approaches. To make this
        process more simple, Volker provides a consistent team based approach to
        evaluating the time, financial, and resource based constraints across
        multiple migration approaches so that the right approach is chosen and
        understood by the entire team.
