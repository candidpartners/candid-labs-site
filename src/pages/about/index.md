## Automate. Everything.

We believe that the process of turning tribal knowledge of software applications into data that can be prioritized, converted into infrastructure as code, deployed, secured, scaled, and optimized in the cloud can be automated.

## Solve. Difficult. Problems.

We all know that the most challenging problems to solve are human problems. It turns out that intelligent data and working software can significantly change how people think about cloud migrations. That's the hill we plan on climbing.

## Independence. Agility. Empowerment.

In 2014 Gartner's Ed Holub proclaimed to 1000 CIO's "Your biggest threat is not the competitor on our magic quadrant. Your biggest threat is a smart kid with a credit card in a cloud account building a great idea". We believe that enabling individuals to create significantly capable cloud based applications with ease is at the core of innovation within your organization.

## Prevent. Security. Failures.

We believe the most secure applications in the world run in the cloud. The ability to deploy applications using infrastructure as code for the first time in history allows us the catch security problems before they ever happen. Gone are the days of accidentally opening up access to sensitive data. New security technology allows organizations the ability to lock down applications and at the same time allow application developers to innovate at the own rate of rapid development.
