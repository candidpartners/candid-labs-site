  title: Why Volker
  description: >
    Candid Labs provides cloud automation software that helps organizations plan
    their journey to the cloud, provision cloud based infrastructure resources

    they are ever deployed to the cloud and continually after they are deployed.

  The Volker Cloud Automation Platform provides DevOps and migration teams with
  Planning, Provisioning, and Compliance capabilities to facilitate factory
  scale cloud initiatives. As an integral part of Candid Cloud Factory, Volker

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That's why we're meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee's
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
